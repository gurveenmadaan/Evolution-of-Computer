          <h2>First Generation Computers</h2>
          <h3>1940s-1950s</h3>
          <p>
            The first generation of computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry
            and magnetic drums for memory. They were large, expensive, and
            generated a lot of heat. ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and
            Computer) and UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer) are examples
            of first-generation computers.

          <h2>Second Generation Computers</h2>
          <h3>1950s-1960s</h3>
          <p>
            This generation introduced transistors, which replaced vacuum tubes,
            resulting in smaller, more reliable, and less power-consuming
            computers. Magnetic core memory replaced magnetic drums, and
            assembly language programming became common. Computers of this era
            include IBM 1401 and UNIVAC II.

          <h2>Third Generation Computers</h2>
          <h3>1960s-1970s</h3>
          <p>
            Integrated circuits (ICs) were introduced during this period,
            allowing multiple transistors and components to be placed on a
            single silicon chip. This led to further miniaturization, increased
            processing power, and reduced cost. High-level programming languages
            like COBOL and FORTRAN were developed. Examples of third-generation
            computers are IBM System/360 and DEC PDP-11.

          <h2>Fourth Generation Computers</h2>
          <h3>1970s-1980s</h3>
          <p>
            Microprocessors, which contained complete central processing units
            (CPUs) on a single chip, were the hallmark of the fourth generation.
            This led to the development of personal computers (PCs) and
            microcomputers. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and operating
            systems like Microsoft Windows emerged during this time. Notable
            computers from this generation include the IBM PC, Apple Macintosh,
            and Commodore 64.

          <h2>Fifth Generation Computers</h2>
          <h3>1980s-Present</h3>
          <p>
            The fifth generation of computers is characterized by parallel
            processing, artificial intelligence, and advanced networking
            capabilities. VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology allowed
            for even more components to be packed onto a single chip, enhancing
            performance. Supercomputers and high-performance computing clusters
            are a prominent feature of this generation.
